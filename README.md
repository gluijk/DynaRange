# DynaRange
A new, modern and easy to use tool to measure camera sensor's dynamic range.

The basic usage will be as follows:
1) Prepare the camera on a tripod to photograph a screen's monitor
2) Display a special chart that contains patches from black to white (supplied)
3) Take a photo of the screen at each ISO setting in RAW format
4) Put the lens cup and take a photo at base ISO (a drak frame)
5) Display a white screen and take a totally overexposed photo (saturation frame)
6) Load all RAW files into DynaRange
7) Get the measurements
